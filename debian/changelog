    headers and kdebase-workspace-bin is the only package which depends on it.

    scripts as kdm has it built-in.
  * Make kdebase-workspace-bin recommend polkit-kde-1 | policykit-1-gnome.

    libkdecorations4 and libkwineffects1 instead of kde-window-manager now
    that kde-window-manager contains nothing one can link against.
